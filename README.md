# exercise-2

##`Abstract`
 >This home work is aimed to strengthen our apprehension of python language, and to practise the knowledge we've learned in last class.At this time,3 ways have been tried to complete exercise 2, utilizing order(print()),matplotlib and coding respectively.The coding method is used the most frequently in both exercise for it's the most efficient approach.
 
___
##`Background`
###1. reviewing what we've learned in last 2 classes, getting prepared for what we're going to learn then.
###2. making name move horizentally on the screen.
###3. assembling soever you want in a 80*80 bitmap on screen, and making it rotate.

##`Exercise`
##`exercise-2`

###`method 1`
###using 'print()' order to show name on the screen, then type `'clear'` to clean the screen,then insert a `blank` in front of the former syntax, print.

###`method 2`
###Scince I've printed my name using matplotlib in last [homework](https://github.com/LuxAsteria/exercise-1), this time I want to mainly focus on how to make the picture move on the screen.It's quiet easy, just to change the parameters of x, then the name is moved without any effort.
###This is the picture of name I've printed:

###This is the moved one

###`method 3`
###To be time-saving, I choose to move the name as a whole(in the form of a picture, rather than move it as syntaxes) using codes.

##`exercise-3`
###The picture I want to show on the screen mostly is doge (=v=). Here, I use the following method assembling two doges.It's quiet difficule and time-consuming to print the characters one by one just to assemble the doges (orz),so to achieve my goal by coding is definitly a better way.I've shown 2 initial photos and the pictures I transferred down here:
###The original photo(1):

###The picture I've assembled:

###The second step is to rotate my pciture.Here's the pictures rotated.

##Conclusion
###This time, I've token 3 different methods to actualize the goal of moving the name horizentally,and apparently the third one consumes the less time. In the next exercise, the picture was in the form of jpg was converted into ascii to assemble a figure on the screen,and then rotated.Most of my work are finished by taking advantage of coding. If anybody is interested in my work or has some marvolous suggestions, welcome to communicate with me.Thank you for viewing.
