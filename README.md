___
##`Background`
###1. reviewing what we've learned in last 2 classes, getting prepared for what we're going to learn then.
###2. making name move horizentally on the screen.
###3. assembling soever you want in a 80*80 bitmap on screen, and making it rotate.

##`exercise-2`
###Scince I've printed my name in last [homework](https://github.com/LuxAsteria/exercise-1), this time I want to mainly focus on how to make the picture move on the screen.
###This is the picture of name I've printed:
![name](https://github.com/LuxAsteria/test3/blob/master/method1.png)

###To be time-saving, and because the os.system('cls') order doesn't work(reture 32512),I choose to move the name as a whole(in the form of a picture, rather than move it as syntaxes).
###`method_1`

##`exercise-3`
###The picture I want to show on the screen mostly is doge (=v=). Here, I use the following method assembling two doges.It's quiet difficule and time-consuming to print the characters one by one just to assemble the doges (orz),so to achieve my goal by coding is definitly a better way.I've shown 2 initial photos and the pictures I transferred down here:
###The original photo(1):

###Here's the code:

###The second step is to rotate my pciture.Here's the pictures rotated.
